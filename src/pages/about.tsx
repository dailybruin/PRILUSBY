      <p>
        In this Winter 2019 issue, we hope to strike a chord on the subject of
        identity. Weâ€™re all on a mission to better understand ourselves within
        the context of our communities as we forge a sense of who we are and,
        more importantly, who we might become.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of us search for ourselves in our memories of the past, which we
        may uncover in places as unexpected as our online shopping carts to
        keepsakes as familiar as the recipes of our childhoods. From quotidian
        commutes through Berlin to half-packed games at Pauley Pavilion during
        peak sports season, the adventures and places contributors have
        investigated enlighten our search for a Bruin identity in relation to
        the sprawling places that surround us. We also featured the voices of
        those who are often overlooked, if not silenced, by the UCLA community,
        from the driven nonstudents who tread Bruin Walk to those who seek
        recovery from personal struggles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our habits and all we hold dear can also play a role in how we seek
        change over the years, as one writer examined the psychological toll of
        being the lifelong fan of a controversial figure. But even when the
        things we cherish most are lost to forces beyond our control, we find
        ways to move forward and live for ourselves. In the end, we pen our own
        narratives, and the most beautiful stories are often considerate of
        those others write alongside us.
